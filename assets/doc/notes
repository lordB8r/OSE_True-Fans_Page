3 Key data aspects needed:
	Either Youtube video link, or video to post to Youtube
	Users true fan user-name
	Thumbnail for video

Key details need to know:
	How do we retrieve these videos?
		Do the users upload them to some sort of database?
		Do they upload them to Youtube themselves, and then send the link to an admin?
		Do they send the video to an Admin to start off with? And then they put them in some sort of data-structure?
		Or do the admins just receive links to the videos and store them in a spreadsheet?

	How do we correlate the videos to user-names?
		Are user names and videos paired in a spreadsheet? Database Relation?
	
	How should we choose the thumbnail for the video on the website?
		Are they chosen, and sent in to an Admin by the user?
		Does the Admin go through the video and choose a snippet him/herself?
		Or are they random pictures that the user sends in to the Admin with the video?

	How should navigation work?
		Should the images on the webpage be embedded videos?
		Should they be links to a Youtube page? Or should they take you to that user's true-fan page (where the video link will be)?
		Are those links at the top (the OSE partners) links to their websites? Or are they just stating who their partners are? 
		Should there be a navigation to a "contact us" page?
		Should the Join button open a form, or should it redirect the user?
