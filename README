+ !-----------Daniel Tocila's instructions--------!

The html file uses a script to access a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is a public
Google Drive spreadsheet. In order to make a spreadsheet public, you click on the
share button and select the global option. (Make sure you allow only viewing rather
than public editing. If you enable public editing, anyone can ruin the spreadsheet's
formula by inserting foreign data or deleting crucial information.)

The first column is for usernames, the second column is for thumbnail links, and the 
third column is for video links. For now, clicking on a thumbnail redirects you to
Youtube's homepage. To redirect to a specific video, you could add a specific video
link in the video column. 

Since the spreadsheet is publicly available on Google Drive, any modifications will 
be reflected in the webpage the next time the user refreshes the page. For example, 
if the spreadsheet has data for five users, the webpage will display five thumbnails.
However, if I add data for five additional users, refreshing the webpage will display
ten thumbnails. New users can be added to the spreadsheet whenever it is necessary. 
The script will take that information and dynamically create HTML that displays the
new thumbnails as a part of the image grid.

In order to modify the spreadsheet, you need to be given permission. If you want to use
your own spreadsheet, you need to make a spreadsheet, share it so that it's public,
and get the spreadsheet key. The spreadsheet key is the string between the "?key=" and the 
"#gid-0"parts of the spreadsheet's URL. Once you know your key, go into the html file
and paste it into the PASTE_KEY_HERE section of the following code

$.getJSON( "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/PASTE_KEY_HERE/od6/public/values?alt=json-in-script&callback=?",

Then modify the script as necessary, if you're interested in doing something else with the data.

Limitations: 

1) Currently, all the images must be the same size in order to properly align. I will be working
on JavaScript to resize images into a standard size.

2) It does not yet display a username when you hover over an image. But that will be added
in an update.

3) There are no specific videos for me to work with at this point in time, so
the video URL is the same for all the rows. In actuality, the video column would have
links to specific videos. These videos would correspond with the user's thumbnail.
