In default.js file, found in the assets/js/ folder, under the function sendEmail(), replace Matt@Zavteq.com in window.location, with the desired OSE email address.

To associate webpage with Paypal donations, do the following:

1. Go to Paypal and either make an OSE account, or log into an existing account.

2. Then click on the "Merchant Services" tab located near the top of the page, under the Paypal logo, in the list of blue tabs (it is the second to last one in the list).

3. Then click on "create payment buttons for your website."

4. When you arrive at the next page, fill out all the fields as desired, but make sure that you select donations from the drop down bar under "choose button type." When done click “create button” at the bottom of the page.

5. On the next page, skip the instructions at the top and go to the section near the bottom that shows the HTML code. You will see two tabs one labeled "Website" and the other "Email" click on the "Email" tab, and copy the code that appears.

6. Now go to the default.js file, in the assets/js/ folder, and under the function makeDonation(), replace the URL in window.open() with the copied code.
